            <h2>My Video Game History</h2>
            <p>
                My first video game was the Pokemon series. I mainly played <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Yellow">Pokemon Yellow</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Yellow">Pokemon Ruby</a>.
            </p>
            <p>However, these games soon got stolen by other kids so I would not be able to play video games. In my last year of high school, my friends in the high school IT decided to give me a copy of <a href="https://starcraft.com/en-us/">Starcraft</a> they had. I played it, and it was entertaining. I often won by either amassing tons of weak units early (like a zombie raid) to win, or colonize rapidly (like rats) to gain resources to develop late-game units. </p>
            <p>In college, I originally planned to not play any games and did not bring any games with me. However, I was put in a gaming hall way of an isolatd (compared to other dorms) gaming dorm. I ended up getting a copy of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/6060/Star_Wars_Battlefront_2_Classic_2005/">Star Wars Battlefront II</a> as my first shooter. </p>
            <p>Later on, my friends exposed me to various RPGs such as <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/agecheck/app/22300/">Fallout 3</a>, <a href="https://zo.p-insurgence.com/">Pokemon Omicron/Zeta</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/agecheck/app/22330/">Elder Scrolls Oblivion</a>, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/agecheck/app/489830/">Skyrim</a> in addition to strategy games such as <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/236850/Europa_Universalis_IV/">Europa Universalis</a>, which motivated me to learn world history so I could crush it, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/281990/Stellaris/">Stellaris</a>, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/233860/Kenshi/">Kenshi</a>.</p>
            <p>Nowadays, I have little time to play games but since <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/413150/Stardew_Valley/">Stardew Valley</a> does not require a lot of mods, I occasionally play the game. </p>
            <p>However, my game library is ever increasing since I am subscribed to Humble Bundle. </p>

            <h2>My Manga/Manhwa and Anime History</h2>
            <p>While growing up, the animated TV shows I watched were some episodes of the first season of Pokemon and various Disney movies. I did not watch much TV. In college, I was introduced to various anime due to the dorm I was staying in, but none of it really stuck. In my senior year of college, however, I was looking for some sort of entertainment (My college was in suburbs, I did not want to pay expensive movie theater tickets, and I watched everything there was on Netflix at the time. ) Hearing that my friends were in an anime club, I decided to watch it. </p>
            <p>Watching anime was entertaining. I liked reading stories while I grew up. So, instead of taking a lot of time to play video games in order to find out/create my story in a fantasy setting, I began to watch anime where the storyline was already created. Sadly, most of the links are blocked by current school servers (since I am in school right now), I am unable to provide viable links to the anime. The best anime I watched before quitting was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overlord_(novel_series)">Overlord</a> The funniest anime was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aho-Girl">Aho (Idiot) Girl</a>. </p>
            <p>With the anime episodes airing slowly, I began to get frustrated with the amount of time it took to watch them. I first began to read web novels due to web novels being complete for some of the anime so that I could know the plot. For instance, I ended up reading all of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/That_Time_I_Got_Reincarnated_as_a_Slime">That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime</a> due to an interesting take on a reincarnation series of adventure anime. </p>
            <p>I stopped watching anime completely when I watched <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Piece">One Piece</a> since the latter episodes began to feel like I was watching 25 minutes of a staring contest that did not advance plot until five episodes later. </p>
            <p>However, I still enjoyed viewing the imagined scenery, which led me to read manga adoptions of the anime. Currently, I have been using manga to find interesting novels and reading them. </p>
            <p>In terms of manga (Japanese comics), manhwa (Korean comics), and manhua (Chinese comics), I dislike manhua the most since they are rarely translated well. I do not like manga as much in my favorite genre since Japanese protagonists tend to lack backbone (The protagonists forgive murderers and wonder why they keep coming to kill them, resulting in an ever increasing collateral damage.) Lately, most manhwa are translated well and have piqued my interests in some of the novels. I will list their links below (listed from what I liked the most to least). </p>

            <h2>My Novel History</h2>
            <p>In college, I would often end up watching a TV show series or movie by reading the plot on wikipedia. Since movies nowadays are 2 hours long, I can save 1 hour and 55 minutes by reading the summary. I can also save traveling time required to go to movie theaters and any related expenditures. Since I can read novels anywhere, bookmark whenever, and resume reading any time, I began to read novels a lot more.</p>
            <p>Currently, the novels I am reading include the manga links I provided above. </p>
            <p>The order in terms of interest is mostly the same. Overlord may be at a top level in terms of interest but I have not been able to read it yet. I have listed the links again in order of strongest interest to last. The differences in the list are due to some novels or manwa/manga not being available in the other's formats or not being that great in other formats. </p>

    <!-- Hi Daniel, this is a great implementation! The fixed sidebar was a great touch, though I'm sure you noticed how changing the position to "fixed" removes an element from the standard flow – normal flexbox rules don't apply.

I did notice some extra wrappers (<main> followed by <div class="main">) and am not sure why those were used.

Our goal wasn't to make a responsive site (yet), but I do always play around with my window size when looking at student projects. It can help to make sure that the underlying structure is set up well.

In this case, I noticed that even though your containers have very generous padding, your resume content started to overlap with your profile content when my window was somewhat narrow.

On line 47, you are declaring a percentage width for the <aside>, but on line 58, you also have a width for the profile container inside it. Since we are not flexboxing as normal anyway with the main containers (due to the fixed sidebar), I'd suggest reorganizing as follows...

1) Remove the width on the profile class and only set it on the <aside>. You can use the pixel size rather than a percentage to make sure that your content never gets too small.

2) Remove the width on the <main>, as you already have containers inside that have a max-width. Alternatively, remove the max-width on the .containers and set it on the <main>. Each of those .containers could just be used for padding. With semantic tags, these could be <section>s instead, but that is not a big deal.

3) Set a margin-left on the <main> that is the same width as the <aside>. This is a good use for CSS variables!

Style-wise, you have such a nice optical "line" for your resume content, but large margins for the .subed elements (anything non-header). I'd personally remove that indentation, but that is my style and affinity for clean edges.

That font also reads a bit small on my screen.

Your one "bug" is on line 92  of your CSS. If you change "block" to "flex", you can use align-items and justify-content to center the icons within the circles.

It was great to see your resume with full content! Much more informative than my short demo version. -->
